# New York City Transit Frequency Visualization

This script and library uses the [Transitland Datastore](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-datastore) to create a transit frequency visualization for the five boroughs of New York City.

Potential improvements:
- The TransitlandAPIReader could be generalized into a gem.
- The run.rb script could take a job spec input to produce GeoJSON files for multiple days and cities (bounding boxes) in a single run.
